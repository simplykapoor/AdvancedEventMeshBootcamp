## Exercise 2 - Learn Publish-Subscribe pattern using S/4 HANA, AEM and Cloud Integration
In this exercise, we will learn an end-to-end publish-subscribe pattern using S/4 HANA, AEM and Cloud Integration. We will publish a Business Partner Change event from S/4Hana to an AEM topic using RAP-based events. The event will then be sent from the topic to two queues, which act as topic subscribers. Finally, two independent subscribers will receive the event by listening to their respective queues.

## Exercise 2.1 - Create new Queue in Advanced Event Mesh for second subscriber
After completing these steps you will have created a queue in Advanced Event Mesh.

1. Go back to the original tab in your browser of AEM and click on **"Cluster Manager"** on the left.
2. In the All Services screen click on the **"Broker Asia"** tile.

	**HINT:** If you cannot see the tiles, uncheck the "**Only show my services**" box.

5. In the pop up enter the queue name: **User_XXX_WebApp** (replace **XXX** with your assigned user number) and click **"Create"**

   ![](./images/ex3-3-3.png) 

6. On the next screen keep all the default settings and click **"Apply"**

8. Switch to the **"Subscriptions"** tab and click on **"+ Subscription"**.

   ![](./images/ex3-3-5.png)  

9. Enter following topic: **"s4/t41/400/ce/groupXX/BusinessPartner/Changed/v1"** (replace **XX** with your assigned user number). Click on **"Create"**.

	![](./images/ex3-3-6.png)

10. Simlarily subscribe to the same topic **"s4/t41/400/ce/groupXX/BusinessPartner/Changed/v1"** in the first queue **"User_XXX"** (replace **XXX** with your assigned user number) that you created in Exercise 1.2

## Exercise 2.3 - Configure First Subscriber using Cloud Integration capability of SAP Integration Suite
In this exercise, an Integration Flow is added as a subscriber via the Advanced Event Mesh adapter using the Solace Messaging Format (SMF). Integration flows can be used to mediate events, for example, to perform message transformation or protocol conversion steps.

### Exercise 2.3.1 - Setup REST Endpoint

Before we start building our integration flow, we will "provision" a simple HTTP endpoint where we will send the message.

1. **Webhook.site (HTTP endpoint)**

    For simplicity purposes, our REST consumer will be a simple HTTP endpoint that will receive the messages from the queue. We will use a tool called [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to create a temporary endpoint that will receive the messages. When you navigate to the website, you will be presented with a unique URL that you can use to receive the messages. **Take note of the unique URL** as we will use it to configure the REST consumer.

    ![](assets/20250819_002635_image.png)

### Exercise 2.5.1. Monitor Consumed Messages
As S/4 Hana system published an event to a topic, all queues subscribed to that topic have received the event. This means the integration flow configured in Exercise 2.3 is executed and also the standalone web application should have received the event.

1. Navigate to "**Monitor-> Integrations and APIs**". Open the **"Manage Integration Content"** tile.

    ![](./images/ex2-17.png)

2. Search for your integration flow. It should be in **"Started"** status. Press **"Monitor Message Processing"** to view the processed Messages.

    ![](./images/ex2-18.png)

3. You should see at least one Messages in the list with Status **"Completed"**.

   ![](./images/ex2-19.png)

4. Open the webhook site created in Exercise 2.1. Here you should the messages sent from Cloud Integration. Notice the format and structure was slightly changed by the integrtation flow mapping.

   ![](./images/ex2-20.png)

5. You should also see your entry in the standalone web application. Be aware that if you send a business partner with the same ID, an update of the existing entry will be triggered instead of creating a new entry.
